    Problem 1: Getting familiar with flask package (25 points)
     In this problem, we will get familiar with the flask python package.  Flask is a library for website development in Python.  It provides fast, flexible, and easy website design framework.  We will use flask to build a simple website. You could read the tutorials for Flask: 
	 https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.

def Terms_and_Conditions():
    ''' 
        By submitting this homework or changing this function, you agree with the following terms:
       (1) Not sharing your code/solution with any student before and after the homework due. For example, sending your code segment to another student, putting your solution online or lending your laptop (if your laptop contains your solution or your Dropbox automatically copied your solution from your desktop computer and your laptop) to another student to work on this homework will violate this term.
       (2) Not using anyone's code in this homework and building your own solution. For example, using some code segments from another student or online resources due to any reason (like too busy recently) will violate this term. Changing other's code as your solution (such as changing the variable names) will also violate this term.
       (3) When discussing with any other students about this homework, only discuss high-level ideas or use pseudo-code. Don't discuss about the solution at the code level. For example, two students discuss about the solution of a function (which needs 5 lines of code to solve) and they then work on the solution "independently", however the code of the two solutions are exactly the same, or only with minor differences (variable names are different). In this case, the two students violate this term.
      All violations of (1),(2) or (3) will be handled in accordance with the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.  For more details, please visit: https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty
      Note: we may use the Stanford Moss system to check your code for code similarity. https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/
      Historical Data: in one year, we ended up finding 25% of the students in that class violating this term in their homework submissions and we handled ALL of these violations according to the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.

    # CHANGE HERE: if you have read and agree with the term above, change "False" to "True".

    (Hello World Page) In the first URL ('/'), let's create a simple page: when a user visited the homepage of our website, we just return a string 'Hello World!'. This is a static homepage, where the content of the webpage is always the same. 
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * webpage: a webpage returned to the user's browser when a user visits the URL, a string of plain text or html.
    ---- Hints: --------
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    (Random Number Page) In the second URL ('/rand'), let's create a simple dynamic page and send each user some different data in the webpage: Each time when a user visits this page, randomly generate a number (between 0 and 1) and return the string of the number back to the user. So when users visit this page multiple times, the user will see a different random number each time. 
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * webpage: a webpage returned to the user's browser when a user visits the URL, a string of plain text or html.

    (Vote Page) In the third URL ('/vote/<ID>'), let's create a simple webpage for users to send data to the website host: Each time when a user visits this page with a number (ID) in the URL (for example, /vote/10), return a webpage with 'Thank you for voting <ID>' (for example, 'Thank you for voting 10'). 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * ID: the ID of a user votes for, an integer scalar.

    (Template) create a jinja2 template that can be used to render 'Hello, <username>!' In this template, we need to have a variable named 'username'. For example, if the username ='Alex', when rendering this template, the returned string will be 'Hello, Alex!'; If the username = 'Bob', when rendering this template, the returned string will be 'Hello, Bob!'.
