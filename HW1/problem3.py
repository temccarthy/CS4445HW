    (Loading Data) Let's start with the raw data, 'moneyball_batting.csv'. Let's load this CSV file into a pandas dataframe (X).. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * filename: the file name of a CSV file, a string.
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * X: a dataframe containing the batting data of all players in all years, loaded from moneyball_batting.csv.
    ---- Hints: --------
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    (Filtering by Year) The dataset contains records of all years. In this study, suppose we just want to choose players for the year 2002, based upon data of year 2001.  We need to first search the data records of year 2001 only.. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * X: a dataframe containing the batting data of all players in all years, loaded from moneyball_batting.csv.
        * year: an integer scalar, the year of the data to be used.
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * X1: a dataframe containing the batting data only in the searched year (2001).
    ---- Hints: --------
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    If you have passed the previous test case, the result data frame should have been saved into a file, called 'moneyball_X1.csv'. This 2001 dataset contains multiple records for each player: a same player may have two/three records, because the player has changed team in year 2001. For example, playerID='guilljo01' (or 'houstty01') has two rows.  We need to sum the game statistics of the same player together, so that each player only contains one row in the data frame. For example if the same player with ID 'player1' has three rows of records, 'player2' has two rows of records: 
	player ID  | H  | AB 
	--------------------- 
	  player 1 | 5  | 10 
	  player 1 | 3  | 20 
	  player 1 | 1  | 30 
	  player 2 | 1  | 40 
	  player 2 | 2  | 50 
	  player 3 | 1  | 60 
	--------------------- 
 we should sum the data for each player into one row: 
	player ID  | H          | AB 
	----------------------------------------- 
	  player 1 | 9=(5+3+1)  | 60 = (10+20+30) 
	  player 2 | 3=(1+2)    | 90 = (40+50) 
	  player 3 | 1          | 60 
	----------------------------------------- 
 (Group by playerID) Given a data frame of batting statistics (X1), group the data records with respect to playerID, so that the game statistics are added together for each player. For example, player 'houstty01' has two rows, where the number of hits (column H) has values: 58, 4 We want to combine these two rows into one row, such that all the game statistics are the sum of the raw values (for example, number hits now should be 58+4 = 62) . 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * X1: a dataframe containing the batting data only in the searched year (2001).
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * X2: a dataframe containing the batting data in the year (2001) after grouping the statistics for players.
    ---- Hints: --------
        * You could use some function implemented in problem2.py to solve this problem. 
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    If you have passed the previous test case, the result data frame should have been saved into a file, called 'moneyball_X2.csv. Now the dataset only contains game statistics, but no information about the players is available, like first name, last name, weight, height, etc. We have another CSV file 'moneyball_player.csv', which contains the player information, such as first name, weight, height, etc. It would be better if we can combine these two datasets into one data frame, so the new data frame contains both game statistics and player information. 
 (Merge the two dataframes) Given a data frame (X2) of batting statistics , and a data frame (Y) of player information (loaded from 'moneyball_player.csv'), Combine the two data frames into one, according to the playerID column. .

    If you have passed the previous test case, the result data frame should have been saved into a file, called 'moneyball_X3.csv'. Now the dataset contains both game statistics and player information. However, we still need to know the salary of each player in year 2002, which represents the market price of each player in 2002, in order to hire the player into our team. We have another CSV file 'moneyball_salary.csv', which contains the player's salary information in all years. We first need to find the players' salaries only in year 2002, then we want to merge the salary information into the dataset. 
 (Filter salary for year 2002) Given the dataframe (Z) containing players' salary data of all years, filter the dataframe with year 2002, return the salary data only in year 2002.

     If you have passed the previous test case, the result data frame should have been saved into a file, called 'moneyball_X4.csv'. This file contains all the information we need for player evaluation.

Any player who has smaller number of AB than min_AB in X4 should be excluded.
