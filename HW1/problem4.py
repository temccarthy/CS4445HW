    Problem 4: (Moneyball) Player Ranking for Oakland A's Baseball Team (OAK) in year 2002 (27 points)
    In this problem, you will rank baseball players for Oakland A's using different methods
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.

    (Compute Players' Batting Average) Given a dataframe (X6) of all the candidate players, compute the Batting Average (BA) of each player and insert a new column named 'BA' to store the data. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * X6: a dataframe containing all the candidate players for evaluation in the year (2001), who have sufficient experience (at least min_AB) and affordable price tag (at most max_salary).
    ---- Hints: --------
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    If you have passed the previous test case, the result data frame should have been saved into a file, called 'moneyball_X7.csv'.  Now let's rank all of these players using the traditional metric: Batting Average. 
(Rank Players by BA) Given a dataframe (X7) of all the candidate players, rank all the players based upon descending order of Batting Average (BA). 
 If you have solved this problem and passed the test case, the result data frame will be saved into a file, called 'moneyball_R1.csv'. You could take a look at the ranking results of the players. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * X7: a dataframe containing all the candidate players info, including Batting Average (BA).
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * R1: a dataframe containing candidate players ranked by descending order of Batting Average (BA).
