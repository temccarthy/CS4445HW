    Problem 4: Ranking webpages using PageRank (AKA random walk with restart using matrix G) (48 points)
    In this problem, you will implement the ranking algorithm for webpages using PageRank (random walk with restart on the revised hyperlink graph to solve both sink node and sink region problems). 
 ------------------------------------ 
      Search Engine (Version 3) 
 ------------------------------------ 
 In this version of the search engine, we implement use random walk method on a revised hyperlink graph to address both sink node and sink region problem. (1) If a webpage has no hyperlink (which is a sink node), add a hyperlink from this webpage to all the webpages in the network (including itself); (2) for every step of the random walk, the user will have a small probability to jump to a random webpage ignoring the hyperlinks and a large probability to follow the hyperlink
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.

    Given two vectors of the webpage scores, check whether or not all the values in the two vectors are close enough. For example, if the tolerance (tol) is 0.1, the two values a and b are called 'close' if the absolute difference between the two values |a-b|<=0.1. Now when we have two vectors of values x, y, the two vectors are 'close' if all values of the two vectors are 'close'.

    ---- Outputs: --------

    ---- Example: --------
        For example, suppose we have two vectors x=[1.05, 4.03], y=[1.02, 4.05], if the tolerance is 0.1, then x and y are 'close'. In this case, the returned result (c) should be True
        For example, suppose we have two vectors m=[1.05, 4.03, 0.16], n=[1.02, 4.05, 0.35], if the tolerance is 0.1, then m and n are NOT 'close', because the last element is not close to each other within the tolerance. In this case, the returned result (c) should be False
