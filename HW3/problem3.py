    Problem 3: Ranking webpages using counts of in-links (15 points)
    In this problem, you will implement the ranking algorithm for webpages using the counts of in-links. 
 ------------------------------------ 
      Search Engine (Version 2) 
 ------------------------------------ 
 The earliest version of Google search is simply counting the number of in-links (the hyperlinks from other webpages to this webpage) 
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.
'''

#----------------------------------------------------
'''
    Given an adjacency matrix A of a webpage hyperlink network, compute the counts of in-links for each webpage in the network. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * A: the adjacency matrix indicating the hyperlinks between webpages, a numpy matrix of shape (n X n). A[i][j] =1, if there is a hyperlink from webpage j to webpage i; A[j][i]=0, if there is no hyperlink from webpage j to webpage i.
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * c: the number of in-links for each webpage, a numpy vector of length n, where c[i] is the number of in-links pointing to webpage i.
    ---- Hints: --------
        * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code.

    Given the counts of in-links of each webpage and the dataframe storing all the webpages (X1), insert a new column (named 'Inlinks') to the dataframe X1 to store the number of inlinks for each webpage. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
        * X1: a dataframe of all the webpages containing the column of word frequency, where each row represents a webpage.
        * c: the number of in-links for each webpage, a numpy vector of length n, where c[i] is the number of in-links pointing to webpage i.
    ---- Outputs: --------
        * X1: a dataframe of all the webpages containing the column of word frequency, where each row represents a webpage.

    ---- Outputs: --------
        * R2: a dataframe of all the webpages, where the webpages are sorted according to descending order of the number of in-links.
